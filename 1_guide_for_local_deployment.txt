1. Create a folder on Desktop named "streamlit" and create a file named "my_app.py" inside it.

	open conda terminal or command terminal and cd to this "streamlit" folder

2. Create virtual environment

 a. method 1: from anaconda promt

   to create environment:
   conda create -n env_name 
   conda env list

   to activate environment:
   conda activate env_name
   source activate env_name (mac users)
   (or       activate env_name)
   (conda deactivate  -> for windows users)
   (source deactivate -> for mac users)

   to deactivate environment:
   conda deactivate  (for windows users)
   source deactivate (for mac users)

   to delete/remove environment:
   conda remove --name env-name --all (deletes/removes environment with all packages)
       

 b. method 2: from terminal (vscode, command promt, gitbash, mac terminal)

   to create environment:
   python -m venv env_name (windows)
   python3 -m venv env_name (mac terminal)

   to activate environment:
   env_name/Scripts/activate (vscode)
   source env_name/Scripts/activate (gitbash)
   source env_name/bin/activate (mac terminal use "bin" instead of Scripts) 

   to deactivate environment:
   deactivate (for vscode or gitbash)

   to delete/remove environment:
   rm -rf env_name (for vscode, gitbash, mac users)


   (python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip) if required

  
 c. method 3 : from anaconda

     create environment (by mouse)
     no activation required
     select environment we created and go Home page
     install jupyter Notebook into the environment and go back Environments page
     click on the green arrow near the environment name and select "Open with Jupyter Notebook"
     upload your files here and open terminal
     run the following code on terminal to see all environments
     
       conda install nb_conda_kernels

     close terminal and Jupyter Notebook and then go environment and reopen Jupyter Notebook on it
     open your ipynb file and seleck kernel
     open app file and start to work with them
  
  
3. add packages into venv

  a. method 1: 

   pip install streamlit==1.22.0
   pip install scikit-learn==1.2.2

or 
 
   b. method 2:       
   (if you already have requirements file)
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt

"""(pip list) to see the packages
   (pip freeze > requirements.txt) to create requirement file""""
   
   
  to see Python version: python -V
  to see packages we installed: pip list

4. to run application file
   streamlit run my_app.py
